# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
The Work Day Scheduler is a Daily Planner which allows the user to schedule items in any of the 1 hour Time Blocks in the current work day. While not part of a comprehensive calendaring solution the Work Day Scheduler provides continuity by storing scheduled items in Local Storage so they can be seen next time the Scheduler is loaded. Current Time Blocks are coloured Pink, Time Blocks from earlier in the day are coloured Grey and Time Blocks from later in the day are coloured Green.
